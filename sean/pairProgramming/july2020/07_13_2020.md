readability enhanced by consistent and clear naming conventions. also comments to explain when something becomes unclear for sake of efficiency

**Test driven development (TDD)- process in which tests are written before features. ?ensures predictable i/o?
- red, green, refactor
    - red = failure
        - write test that will intentionally fail
    - green = passed
        - write test so that it will pass in simplest way
    - refactoring = rewriting code
        - rewrite to clean up code (effinciency and readability)
- naming convention - file.js => file.test.js

function `it()`

it('description of test (STR)', callbackFn = () =>{
    expect(val).toBe(otherVal)    // expect returns object
})                                  //iff expect === toBe then PASSED

**AAA Pattern                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          - Arrange, Act, Assert
