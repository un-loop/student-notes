# 7 Ways to get the most of of pair programming

pair programming originated as part of Extreme Programming movement
?more research required on what Extreme Programming is?
a: software development methodology based arond short development cycles and increased customer participation

can be described as 'code review with context'. By suggesting code reviews with the code directly in front of the participants, time delay can be almost totally negated between suggestion and implementation, and context can be given for confusing or unclear chunks of code that makes suggestions more relevant and effecient.

## 7 ways

* respect one another
    cooperative exercises become counterproductive when they are arenas for destructive conflict

* mindful communication
    listen well to your partner's feedback, and respond intentionally. pair programming is effective because it is an avenue for communication, but it is only as effective as the communication it facilitates. avoid excessive use of jargon and clarify whether your partner knows obscure terms you might use in a way that avoids demeaning them.

* set expectations
    setting ground rules at the start of the meeting can avoid unwanted conflicts during the meeting. getting permission to use hardware can go a long way towards avoiding misunderstanding or offence.

* let the junior drive (most of the time)
    the less experienced should spend a significant amount of time at the keyboard. this forces sr's to explain their code, because someone else needs to write it. this gives sr's practice in explanation and teaching, while it gives the jr's valuable knowledge and experience. occasionally switch positions so that jr's can see what workflow looks like with a sr dev.

* keep talking
    'one of the easiest ways to [waste] pair programming time is to sit silently while one of the two partners works.'
    by continually explaining and airing out thoughts, it can potentially expose flawed thought processes early and give the other partner experience with new problem solving methods.

* don't dictate code
    by telling the partner what to type line by line, it allows code to be written by them without an understanding of it. this prevents learning, and feedback can be difficult to give when one doesn't know what the other is trying to accomplish.

* find teachable moments
    find chances to share knowledge and best-practices. avoid oversharing, or you may come off as pedantic.
