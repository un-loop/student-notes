# Part 2, Ch. 1; Intro to Flux and Redux

**Flux - design pattern that links action=>dispatcher=>store=>view=>action in circular link. Built to facilitate tight connection of user-interaction and state changes. React is an close implementation of the Flix design pattern.

### Redux lifecycle:
UI is rendered with state-dependent factors => An action takes place that we want to change the state => The action is passed to a reducer funtion => The function changes the value in the store => Change in store modifies the state => Change in state causes rerender of UI => UI is rendered with state-dependent factors => ...

by closing over the `state` variable in creating our Redux store, we make it so that the state it references is not available outside of the store functions

**Factory Pattern - pattern where we use closures inside a function to lock out access to functions inside of an object.

- First, declare a variable inside of the function.
- Then, declare a function that returns that variable.
- Next, declare a function that modifies that same variable in some way.
- Return an object that contains both functions as properties.

This uses closure to create a private variable that can only be called and modified using the functions returned in the object, increasing security and preventing accidental modifications.

Redux reducers must be 'pure functions':
**pure function --
- Will always have the same output for a given set of inputs
- Does not alter any information outside of the function itself

Redux store uses 'observer pattern' to notify React of state changes.

high-level components use `store.getState()` to pull state instead of storing it internally and checking it with `this.state`

?if `subscribe()` is called inside `componentDidMount()`, and `subscribe()`

all states don't need to remain in Redux. local states are useful for storing form data and displays of elements that will only be contained in the component and not passed along levels.
