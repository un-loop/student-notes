DEFINITIONS

REDUX:  is a library that helps manage application state and keeps all the state in one place in order to update that state  you have to trigger an action to trigger a reducer (function) that modifies that state.

Let
let is similar to var but let has scope. let is only accessible in the block level it is defined.

Const
Const is used to assign a constant value to the variable. And the value cannot be changed. Its fixed.

Arrow Function
There are two parts of the syntax.
The first part is just declaring a variable and assigning the function (i.e) () to it. It just says the variable is actually a function.
Then the second part is declaring the body part of the function. The arrow part with the curly braces defines the body part.

Default Parameters:
Default parameters are parameters which are given by default while declaring a function. But it’s value can be changed when calling the function.

For of loop
for..of iterates through list of elements (i.e) like Array and returns the elements (not their index) one by one.  It works for string too.

Spread attributes
help to spread the expression as the name suggests. In simple words, it converts a list of elements to an array and vice versa.

Math.max is a simple method that returns the maximum element from given list. It doesn’t accept an array.

Maps
Map holds key-value pairs. It’s similar to an array but we can define our own index. And indexes are unique in maps.
-Other interesting features of Maps are all indexes are unique. And we can use any value as key or value.
-map.size; Returns the size of the map.
-map.keys(); // outputs only the keys. 
-map.values(); // outputs only the values.

Sets
Sets are used to store the unique values of any type.
-sets.has return a boolean value based on whether the given element is present in the set or not.

Getters and Setters
The ‘get’ property is used to get the value of the variable and ‘set’ property is used to set the value to the variable.

Continuous Integration?

Explicit Return: This method of returning uses the return keyword to return the result from the function.
Implicit Return: This method of returning doesn't use the return keyword, and returns the function result for you when you are working with a one line function body.
